Overview:
The Yelp Reviews Polarity Analysis project aims to analyze sentiment in customer reviews from Yelp, utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset consists of reviews labeled as either positive or negative based on star ratings, with stars 1 and 2 classified as negative and stars 3 and 4 classified as positive. The primary goal of this project is to preprocess the text data, visualize insights, and build classification models to predict the sentiment of reviews.
